Reviewing: KeyboardController.cs & some of the command classes
Author of file: Carman 
Time: 20 minutes

Chosen code smells:
    1. Long Functions ***
    2. same name different meaning
    3. long parameters
    4. god Objects
    5. Duplicate code
    6. Feature Envy
    7. Data clumps
    8. Comments *
    9. Temporary Field
    10. Large Class

Readability:
    - The file and code is understandable and the code helps understand the 
        thought process better.
    - Variables are well named.
    - There is a todo to make it prettier that has not been changed. Probably 
        would help with how long update is.
    - besides update the file is understandable and well organized.
    - all the command classes are short, well named, and straight to the point. 
        very well done.

Specific Comments:
    - Update is pretty long, and doesn't have only one function.
        Suggested solution: breaking it up into other methods that are 
        called by update.
    - it could have a few more comments to just better explain the funtions 
        of all the dictionaries
