Comments on Code Smells:
No extremely long methods, classes, or parameters. Very easy to follow using comments. 
No duplicate code really or concerning coupling. Changes could be made easily here. 
Not sure if any of these fields count be moved to the constants folder, but I don’t think it should be super concerning.



Comments on Quality
Could simplify Blocklist instance to avoid 2 return statements.
if (instance == null)
 {
          instance = new BlockList();
 }
 return instance;
Using more descriptive variables such as firstBlockIndex, previousBlockIndex, and finalBlockIndex would be more descriptive.
Overall, logic seems pretty sound and works well when ran. I think you did a great job!
