Comments on code smells:
There are two methods with the same name: createSprite(). While this is technically a code smell, I think it's acceptable here since their purpose
is clear and the same. Depending on the interpretation, this could potentially be the same "meaning," or perhaps the different parameter types could
pose a different "meaning." Other than that, none of the other code smells listed above were detected.


Readability comments:

The quality of the code in this file is generally good, with clear structure and adherance to the single responsibility rule. Each method has a distinct
purpose. Good job! As for a hypothetical change, consider if the sprite textures were loaded from an external source. The current implementation couples 
loading from a file system using hardcoded paths. To support the new feature, SpriteFactory would need significant refactoring/revising to allow 
different loading mechanisms. This could potentially be done by abstracting the loading logic into a separate class that supports different source 
types, which could improve that maintainability and flexibility of the system. For the purposes of our game, this shouldn't matter too much, but it is 
something to consider.
