Comments:

Magic numbers for level bounds, and consider making a private constant for the tile
sizes rather than referencing CONSTANTS.Level.TILE_SIZE within complex calculations.

To make the file more readable, add comments to collision calculations and delete
unused/commented out code unless is it avtivley being debugged.

Currently y position is being calculated every frame in the update position method.
This could be optimized by calculating y position using s = u + (1/2)at^2. This
could make gravity smoother and possibly more efficent.

Methods are mostly short and sweet, pretty readable and collision and movement look
really good. 

Potential Game Change:

If we decided to add multiplayer to our game in Sprint5, this file should be able
to be resued without any changes since we keep a list of players in game and this
file is used by each player in the list.
