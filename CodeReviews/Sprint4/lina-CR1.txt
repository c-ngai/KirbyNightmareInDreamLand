Chosen code smells:
    1. Long Functions 
    2. same name different meaning
    3. long parameters
    4. god Objects
    5. Duplicate code
    6. Long method
    7. Data clumps
    8. Comments 
    9. Switch Case
    10. Large Class

Maintainability:
    - each class is direct and to the point
    - each method name makes sense
    - particle handles all its doings (instance fields are private)
    - spawn point is not generally intuitive 

Specific Comments:
    - I would just like a ocmment explaining how the spwan point works
        since it is pretty wordy and not intuitive why you are putting in those numbers. 
    - very starightforward and to the point
    - hypothetical change: change isDone to IsDone to follow naming convention.
