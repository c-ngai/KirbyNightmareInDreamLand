Sprint #4
Reviewing: Sound files (sound.cs, soundInstance.cs, soundManager.cs, LoadAllSounds method in LevelLoader)
Author of file: Mark
Time: 20 minutes

Chosen code smells:
    1. Long Functions 
    2. same name different meaning
    3. long parameters
    4. god Objects
    5. Duplicate code
    6. Long method
    7. Data clumps
    8. Comments 
    9. Switch Case
    10. Large Class

Quality:
    - each class is direct and to the point
    - each method name makes sense and is straight to the point
    - the comments make it wasier to understand and follow train of thought
    - Instance fields soudl not be public as much as possible
    - debug lines are awesome
    - you can pre initilaize the booleans in the instance field instead of in initialization.
    - load all sounds seems like it is going to be a very long method if each sound needs to
      have its looping behavior hard coded, could be reworked to be data driven

Specific Comments:
    - Does each sound need to have the looping behavior hard coded?
    - not all your variables follow the same naming conventions, would be better to get it to agree
    wih the rest of the code
    - no magic strings or numbers (good)
    - love all the comments
    - very starightforward and to the point
    - hypothetical change: change variables to not have _  to follow naming conventions.
