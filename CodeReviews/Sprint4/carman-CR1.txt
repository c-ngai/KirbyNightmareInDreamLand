Readability:

	Most of the methods are very short and sweet. They also follow good naming conventions, which both contribute to making the class easily readable. The class itself has a lot 
of methods that makes it difficult to look through and some methods seem to create unwanted coupling such as UpdateLevel (Inappropriate Intimacy). It might be better to move 
details related to level transitions states and/or debug behavior into their own class. I really appreciated the comments in UpdateLevel since the method was more complex than 
the others and the logic would've been hard to figure out on my own. Overall, the class is well done but may require a little more organizing to decrease coupling and increase 
cohesion.

Comments:

	I noticed that one of the methods removePowerUpFromList has no references so I'm wondering if it should be removed unless it will be used later on (YouDon'tNeedItAnymore).
