Comments on Code Smells:
	There are no long functions, as each is under 10 lines. The class is a good size with only a handful 
	of functions. There is a max of 1 parameter and no duplicate code. There isn’t any feature envy and 
	all code is cohesive. There are no switch statements, everything seems easily odifyable without hard 
	consequences, and there are no duplicate names. There isn’t any temporary fields or data clumps.

	Overall, everything here looks good. Very short class and gets the job done. Looks good!

Comments on Readability:
	I could easily look through Star.cs and IParticle.cs and understand what is going on. The sprites 
	have no hitboxes and stay on for a constant number of frames.However, there are currently no comments, 
	so the code might benefit from that. However, overall looks like solid code! Great job!
