Code Quality:

	This class contains a lot of magic numbers that need to be defined in our Constants.cs class. I like that the class contains comments about functionality that 
still needs to be implemented since it is in development and it helps keep track of what still needs to be done. Because the code contained is used to initialize a 
lot of objects, there is a lot of redundant code that only differs by method parameters. This suggests that the code can be refactored and data driven to look cleaner if there
is time to do so.

Hypothetical Change Suggestion:

	If we were to add new Kirby powers or create our own custom HUD designs, the current setup could easily support them by simply changing the sprites being created 
and the locations they are being drawn. This makes it scalable to possible future design overhauls. 

Comments:

	The UI currently looks great and accurately reflects the game. Keep up the good work!
