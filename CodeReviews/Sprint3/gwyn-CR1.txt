Comments on Code Smells:
	CheckSide is a pretty long function, but has a LOT to do within it. Could be chopped 
	into multiple methods/funcitons. The class is a good size though, no crazy params, 
	or duplicate code. No switch statements, but a lot of if statements. Could maybe have 
	used a Dictionary instead, not sure. Seems very hard coded right now, however, it works!

Comments on Readability:
	I appreciate the amount of comments. I appreciate the comments of what we’re doing 
	in the future (ex: “will be moved to object manager”. Could start that with “TO-DO” 
	to make it easier to spot in the future. The large commented out sections make me 
	wonder what happened, so comments would help there.The comments also guide the user
	of what to change or not, which shows your process as you worked. The process is 
	super readable and the working methods are easy to follow. Great job!
