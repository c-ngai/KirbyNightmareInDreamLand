Sprint #3
Reviewing: Various enemy state machines
Author of file: Gwyn
Time: 20 minutes

Chosen code smells:
    1. Long Functions ***
    2. same name different meaning
    3. long parameters
    4. god Objects
    5. Duplicate code
    6. Long method
    7. Data clumps
    8. Comments *
    9. Switch Case
    10. Large Class

Readability:
    - comments make it very clear what is happening
    - the state machines should have acces to what state the sprite
    is changing to, not passing it through the enemy
    - each class is direct and to the point

Specific Comments:
    - the code seems repetitive across every state machine
    - very starightforward and to the point
    - i only do not understand what exit is for, more explenation would be nice
    - hypothetical change: make it so the state works under one class not various classes
