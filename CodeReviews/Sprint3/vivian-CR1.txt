Comments:

This file is very readable, it does exactly what it says it does in a concise manner.

My only comments would be to help with decoupling of MouseController and Game1
you could pass Game1 and RoomList into the MouseController constructor as dependencies
rather than directly accessing Game1 and hard coding the room list. This would likely
make testing easier.

Another design suggestion would be to make it so that the room list loops once you
get to the end of the list. That way if there are many rooms you don't have to click
back through them all to get to the first one. This would help with maintainability.

One small bug I noticed, you never initialize previousMouseState, If there is a
call to Update(), previousMouseState might hold a default value and give incorrect
comparisons.

Because of the clear-cut nature of this file, not a lot of comments were necessary
and the ones provided are helpful and meaningful. Great job!
