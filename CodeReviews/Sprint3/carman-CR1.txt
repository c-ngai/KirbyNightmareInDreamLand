Readability:

	The methods were easy to understand due to great naming choices. Each method met the single purpose principle well and supported high cohesion. There was mention of something
called "culling" that I was confused on that I wish would've been defined by a comment explaining what it was and how it worked. I liked the methods created for DrawBackground
and DrawForeground but it could be argued that the methods aren't doing much beyond calling other methods (Middleman) and it is cohesive enough to the method that the code
could be left in DrawLevel. Overall the class was very well done and looked as concise as they could be without losing functionality. 

Comments:

	There is one comment about making a field private later due to coupling issues that I'm commenting on so it's not forgotten. I'm also curious if the variable 
BackgroundParallaxFactor could be set to private since it is only being used within the class or if it could at least be given a private set so other classes won't 
unknowlingly change it without permission.
