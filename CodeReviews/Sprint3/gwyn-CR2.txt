Comments on Code Smells:
	Functions are very short and legible. The class is pretty small, no long params or duplicate code. 
	No switch cases and changes seem like they would be pretty easy. Everything is legible and works 
	exactly as designed. Only problem I see is the roomList is filled with strings instead of pulling 
	from Rooms.json. If we added new rooms, we would have to remember to go add them. Data driving that 
	would be a better approach. But for right now, looks great!

Comments on Quality:
	All functionality works great. Wish it looped, so if you kept clicking left or right button it 
	would loop through all instead of requiring right or left clicks. However overall, code quality 
	looks great! Nice job!
