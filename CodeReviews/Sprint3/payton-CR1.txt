Comments on code smells:

InappropriateIntimacy: Level has intimate knowledge of the Game1 and Camera classes. Consider introducing higher-level abstractions or
limiting direct acess to _game and _camera.

DataClumps: In the atDoor and nextRoom methods, Rectangle door_rec is created from repeated components ((int)doorPos.X) and (int)doorPos.Y)). This
pattern might benefit from being refactored into a helper method or encapsulated in a class.

No other major code smells were detected. Nice!


Readability comments:

The code has a logical structure and clear methods, contributing to a strong readability. The names of methods are mostly clear, but the readability
could be imporved with single-job comments for each one. Splitting large methods like LoadLevelObjects into smaller, more focused methods would further
enhance readability. Another sidenote, magic numbers such as "0.85f" should be replaced with constants to improve readability, but I see that you have
a comment and plan on doing that, so just don't forget about it! Overall, I didn't have a hard time understanding the code, so the readability is
pretty good so far. Nice work!
