Comments on code smells:

TooManyParameters:
The _spriteBatch.Begin call looks like it uses 7 parameters. Usually the TooManyParameters code smell raises a flag when 
there are around three or more parameters, so this one definitely caught my eye. I'm not 100% familiar with the context of
this call or the logic behind it, but potentially consider simplifying the call for simplicity. If this is unavoidable, then
it's understandable.

InappropriateIntimacy:
The DrawView method interacts with several class members such as cameras and level. This creates tight coupling, however I 
recognize that this might be necessary. Just wanted to point out that the code smell does pop up.

DataClumps:
The cameras array and other related data such as CurrentCamera and ActiveCameraCount are often used togehter. This might
benefit from encapsulation in their own class to group related functionality.

No other major code smells were detected. Nice!


Readability comments:

THe code uses meaningul identifiers, which do a lot for readability and undersrtandability. The comments that exist are effective,
but they are a bit sparse. I think that the code could use some more thoughful comments to explain complicated methods and/or 
choices. There are quite a few lines of code that seem to be commented out, too. I'm not sure if these are just commented out for
the time being and have a plan to be used later or if they are meant to be removed. I would recommend going back and cleaning up 
these comments to improve readability.
