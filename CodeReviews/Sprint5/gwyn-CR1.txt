Comments on Code Smells:
	Some of the functions can be long (such as DrawCollisionTiles() with 40 lines), 
	however, is reasonable. The class is also a bit long, about 350 lines. The params 
	are reasonable at 0-3. There isn’t much duplicated code, feature envy, or switch 
	statements. If any code here was changed drastically, it would impact the other 
	states- however should still be good. The naming conventions seem intuitive and 
	no confusion for meaning. There is a lot of data in each dictionary that has to be 
	loaded in within the class, which could be potentially managed in level loader. 
	No temporary fields. Looks good!

Comments on Readability:
	The code is very readable, with a good amount of comments which I appreciate. Every 
	variable and function called makes sense, so I can tell easily what is going on. 
	I appreciate the descriptions whenever they are left. Overall, I think you did a 
	great job!
