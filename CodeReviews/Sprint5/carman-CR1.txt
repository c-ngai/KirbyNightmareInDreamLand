Readability:

	The methods were mostly simple and concise and followed good naming conventions that made it intuitive to read. I liked that it used meaningful constants to get rid of magic 
numbers for things like velocity and health to help with readability. However, a few magic numbers still need to be taken care of like the 17 and 7 adjustments on projectile position. 
I would also keep in mind the projectileposition method since depending on how you're implementing his briefcase attack, you may want to create a briefcase class that implements 
IProjectile to separate out the two since it may be complicated and harm readability by doing it all within the Professor Kirby class.


Comments:

	I noticed a lot of TODO comments so just a reminder to look over those before submission. Also a reminder to remove commented out temporary debug prints. I really loved the 
art and design you did for Professor Kirby Enemy and that you asked for team feedback on the art while working on it. It turned out fantastic. It was a pleasure working with you!
