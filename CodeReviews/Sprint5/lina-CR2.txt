Chosen code smells:
    1. Long Functions 
    2. same name different meaning
    3. long parameters
    4. god Objects
    5. Duplicate code 
    6. Long method
    7. Data clumps 
    8. Comments 
    9. Switch Case
    10. Large Class

Code Quality:
- currently has magic numbers which is not ideal
- There are a lot of To-Do's at the moment which makes it easier to understand what you
will be doing
- well organized
- all state code is easy to understand and straight forward, since its a copy paste from
 waddle dee it still needs some changes regarding certain class checks that are not relevant
 for the professor
 - currently using waddle dee methods, not ideal

 - overall the states are (mostly) good, but it is hard to critique the main class while it 
 still has so many todo's

 Hypothetical change:
 - clear out magic naumbers -- easily implemented
 - finish clearing out the waddle dee leftovers

Code Smells:
- clear to do comments 
- more comments on state logic would be nice 
- no other obvious code smells
