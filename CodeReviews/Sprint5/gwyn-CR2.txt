Comments on Code Smells:
	None of the functions are particularly long. The class is a bit long, but not bad. 
	The parameters are reasonable (0-3). There isn’t feature envy, switch statements, 
	or potential for shotgun surgery. There is some duplicate code for sounds, since 
	every wall bounce makes the ‘starbounce” noise. There isn’t confusion for what name 
	is what meaning. There aren’t data clumps or any temp fields. Overall, looks good!

Comments on Quality:
	
	The star in game looks great! It bounces as intended. It does sometimes get stuck 
	on walls and makes repetitive sounds, but only in certain circumstances. The actual 
	code itself utilizes features of C# well, deals with this specific collison type, 
	and handles all cases of collision Looks good!
