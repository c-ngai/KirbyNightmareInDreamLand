Code Quality:

	This class is really convoluted just because of the sheer amount of methods required to get Kirby to work. Particularly because I have been working on this class with Mark 
this sprint, we have been focused on correcting bugs and adding features over organizing and separating methods out. There are plans in place to refactor this class and clean it
up to reduce coupling. A lot of old methods should have more comments which has made it more difficult to debug currently. Because of the convolution of the class and its ties to
other classes, shotgun surgery was necessary to implement some of the new features for this sprint such as multiplayer, sprite animations, and other debugging fixes with movement.
It is also experiencing inappropriate intimacy as Kirby is knowing far too much about its state with too many connected conditional calls when it should instead be asking the state
about it with general methods. 

Hypothetical Change Suggestion:

	If we were to implement swimming, the current system would be able to support it by adding new movements/physics and should require additions rather than changes to the 
current class.

Comments:

	Great job on implementing multiplayer and I really appreciate the split screen and arrows pointing to players offscreen.
