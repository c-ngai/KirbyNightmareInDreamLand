Time: 20 minutes

Chosen code smells:
    1. Long Functions 
    2. same name different meaning
    3. long parameters
    4. god Objects
    5. Duplicate code **
    6. Long method **
    7. Data clumps ***
    8. Comments *
    9. Switch Case
    10. Large Class

Readability:
- the code could definitly use more comments to explain what is happening
- the dictionary is pretty big and overly complicated, theresprobably a better way
    to access all the lives since it's repetetive code (a for loop would work)
- on the lives, they probably don't need to be initialized like so
- the dictionaries are repetitive, many dictionaries using the same key could be all
    joined into one guided by power up key and then do something else with live
- lives to text code is overengineered

Code Smells:
- duplicate code and data clumps on dictionary implementations: has not been fixed since last Sprint
- prtty long methods throughout that could be broken down
