Comments on Code Smells:
Didn't notice any of the particular code smells I had been searching for. Good job!


Comments on Code Readability:
Overall pretty readable! A few notes though:

 - Immediately I wish there were comments for some of the fields at the top. Most
 of the fields at the top were pretty immediately understandable as to what their
 intended purpose probably was, but oldBlock and lastBlock isn't so obvious at a
 first glance.

 - Are firstBlock and lastBlock even necessary to store? It's just the index of the
 first and last entries in the list of blocks right? The first will always be 0,
 and the last is just as easy to pull from the list itself as it was to calculate
 lastBlock and store that value. It's subjective, but I would probably do away with
 them.

 - I appreicate the use of curly braces even for control statements with a single
 line inside! It's good practice and makes it a little easier to look at than
 otherwise.

 - Not sure that check in Draw() is entirely necessary, since that condition
 shouldn't ever be false. If it's a failsafe in case something ELSE goes wrong,
 then I suppose there's a case for it to stay.

 - I appreciate the comments above all the methods! Only one missing one is
 Update(), which, simple as it is, could probably have one as well just to
 give a super quick explanation as to what it actually does. Maybe like
 "Updates the current sprite only when the current selected block has changed,
 and then call update on the sprite." (Maybe that's even too wordy)
