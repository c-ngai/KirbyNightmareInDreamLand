Comments on Code Smells:
Pretty good length of the file - no long methods, parameters, or class. No duplicate code within the file and looks concise. 
No crazy coupling, feature envy or switch statements. 
It doesn’t seem the interface ISpriteAnimation is ever used within your file, so that might be able to be removed. 

Comments on Readability
The amount of comments is amazing! I can follow pretty clearly what is going on, even if it is pretty complex. I can tell easily what you want to clean up later, which is good touch.
Pretty sure you checked with Professor Kirby and he said it was okay, but your ISprite Interface is within the Sprite.cs file. 
Overall, I really appreciated your dedication to the sheer number of sprites that were created for this Sprint. 
Your focus on data-driven code and creating a system that is easy for others to implement is much appreciated (as someone who has been using your code as a client this whole sprint). Great work!
