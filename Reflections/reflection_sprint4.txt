Sprint 4 Reflection
11/07/2024

###############################################################################

1. Team Dynamics

This Sprint definitely a bit more relaxed than the previous one. Much of the work
incolved refactoring and cleaning up code from earlier sprints rather than introducing
a ton of major new functionality. Only a few of our roles involved implementing new
features, while the others completely revolved around refactoring/fixing previous code
and working on the backlog. The lighter workload allowed some members to finish their
tasks early, helping us get a headstart on Sprint 5. The team did a good job of staying
on top of deadlines and avoiding the rush we faced previously.

Overall, having a more balaned sprint was beneficial for team morale, and it showed in
out productivity and enthusiasm for Sprint 5 ideas. 


2. Adherence To Deadlines

Our team did a good job sticking to official sprint deadlines compared to the last
sprint. Most of our code reviews were completed early, allowing us to address feedback
and avoid last-minute changes. This was a noticable improvement from previous sprints.

While we did get most tasks done early on in the Sprint, we continue to underestimate
how long certain tasks will take to complete. When we set deadlines for our team in our
team meetings, we tend to set them way too early and can be a bit too ambitious. Going 
forward, we need to set more realistic personal deadlines.


3. Plans for Next Sprint

    *  Assign a person to be in charge of documentation. README and reflection
       as well as the project planning documents should be clean and submittable.
    *  Distribute coding responsibilities more evenly.
    *  Have regular in-person meetings to work on the project.
    *  Make sure that all code reviews get in early
    *  Realistic task estimates, especially considering how much we want to do for
       Sprint 5
