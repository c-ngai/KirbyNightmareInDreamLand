Sprint 5 Reflection

1. Team Dynamics


As expected, this sprint was very very work heavy. Admittedly, we kind of put this onto
ourselves and were expecting to take on a lot, but that doesn't take away from the fact
that this Sprint was probaby one of if not THE most overwhelming of the bunch. Though we
maybe were a bit overly ambitious with our Sprint 5 features, it was super rewarding.
From getting multiplayer to work, to implementing gamepad controls, to seeing the custom
enemy develop, this sprint was by far the most fun we've had all semester. I think that
really helped boost team moral despite everyone's heavy workload. When we ideated our
features for Sprint 5, our team was super enthusiastic and excited for what we planned
to do, and that spirit never really left throughout the sprint. Our support for eachother
and pride in what we were able to accomplish this semester helped our team dynamics
tremendously, and we're super excited to share what we built!


2. Adherence To Deadlines


Well, we really tried our best. Due to our overwhelming amount of Sprint 5 features that
we commited to completing for our final game, we fell a little bit short of our goal by the
time the Saturday noon deadline rolled around. We did get a lot of our features implemented,
but we needed a little extra time to refine some features and fix some bugs. We ended up 
asking Professor Kirby for an extension until midnight Sunday 12/01 last Tuesday, but we have
not gotten a response yet. We decided that it would probably be best to submit what we have and
hope to have the chance to resubmit again after we polish some things up. Overall though, we 
still made a huge amount of progress.
