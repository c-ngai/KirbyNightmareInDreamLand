Sprint 3 Reflection
10/20/2024

###############################################################################

1. Team Dynamics

This Sprint was a doozy! With the semester picking up and midterm season in full
swing, our ability to effectively delegate time to the project while managing other
classes were limited. People who were more available toward the beginning of the sprint
were held up by others who weren't able to contribute until the second half of the
sprint and vice versa.

We received two extensions and still were unable to resolve all of the collision
bugs.

We definitely underestimated how much work collision would be and should have
assigned more than 3 people to the task. 


2. Adherence To Deadlines

Compared to the last sprint, we definitely did much better in getting most of our
code reviews done earlier. 

Because of the huge amount of work that is getting collision on slopes to work,
the functionality of the sprint was not complete, and several bugs got backlogged
making it hard to refactor and clean code as well as have up-to-date documentation.


3. Plans for Next Sprint

    *  Assign a person to be in charge of documentation. README and reflection
       as well as the project planning documents should be clean and submittable.
    *  Distribute coding responsibilities more evenly.
    *  Have regular in-person meetings to work on the project.
