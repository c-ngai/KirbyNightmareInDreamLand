Sprint 2 Reflection
9/28/2024

###############################################################################

1. Team Dynamics

At the beginning of the Sprint, we met several times to help everyone get on the
same page. Lina and Carman were great resources in helping everyone get comfortable
using git and helping Mac set ups.

All of our meetings took place over Zoom. While this made it easy to see others
code, we would prefer to meet in person in the future and make use of the pair
programming process.

Unfortunately, due to my intense coursework outside of 3902, some of us could not
dedicate as much time to this project as we had hoped. Additionally, some project
tasks were much less time-consuming than others. In future sprints, we would like
to split the coding roles and have more equal coding contributions.

2. Sprite Bottleneck

A repeated issue that our group faced throughout Sprint 2 was the inability to
test or implement code due to a lack of animations. This is in no way Mark's fault,
we should have sooner redistributed that workload.We  anticipate that this is a
challenge we will continue to face going into future sprints as all the Kirby
power-up mode animation sprites got backlogged. Going into Sprint 3 we need to
reevaluate how time-consuming that task is and distribute it more evenly among
team members.

3. Adherence To Deadlines

I am writing this 11 hours before this sprint is due. We originally intended to
have a fully functional sprint by the end of week 2, after not meeting that deadline
we should have reassessed to get a better understanding of what was taking more
time than we anticipated, rather than just repeatedly pushing back the deadline.

Because our code wasn't fully functional until the end of week 3, our code
reviews were not done until then either; making it hard to implement and refactor
given the critiques.

This also made the process of cleaning, refactoring, and completing documentation
at the end of the Sprint much more stressful than needed.

4. Plans for Next Sprint

    *  Split up Kirby power-up sprite animation entry evenly. That way not just
       one person is stuck entering 300+ data points.
    *  Assign a person to be in charge of documentation. README as well as the
       project planning documents (for us these were mostly Zoom meeting notes)
       should be clean and submittable.
    *  Distribute coding responsibilities more evenly.
    *  Have regular in-person meetings to work on the project.
