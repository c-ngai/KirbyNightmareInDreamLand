Program Controls:

Left and right arrows move Kirby and 'x' and down arrow allow him to jump and crouch respectively.
The 'a' and 'd' keys change Kirby's facing direction.

The 'z' key lets Kirby inhale air.
The 'n' key lets Kirby attack.

Number keys (1, 2, 3, 4) can be used to show Kirby use a different power-up modes
(Normal, Beam, Fire, Spark). ***

Use 'e' to cause Kirby to take damage.

Use keys "t" and "y" to cycle between which block is currently being shown.

Use keys "u" and "i" to cycle between which item is currently being shown.

Use keys "o" and "p" to cycle between which enemy or npc is currently being shown.

Use 'q' to quit and 'r' to reset the program back to its initial state.

*** NOTE: Due to time constraints and the overwhelming amount
of animations for each powerup, animations for Beam, Fire, and Spark Kirby (other
than right/left facing Kirby) have been backlogged. To be done by Sprint3.
