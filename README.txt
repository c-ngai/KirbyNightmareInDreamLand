Group Members:  Gwyneth Barnholtz, Mark DeLeo, Vivian Ferrigni, Payton Murphy,
                Carman Ngai, Lina Ordonez Aguiar

Project: Sprint2 - implementing Game Objects and Sprites of
         Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland, Level 1 

###############################################################################

Program Controls:

Left and right arrows move Kirby and 'x' and down arrow allow him to jump and crouch respectively.
Two consecutive left or right arrow presses (either hold then press or press press) makes Kirby run.
The 'a' and 'd' keys change Kirby's facing direction. We did not implement 'w' and 's' keys bc Kirby never faces up or down.

The 'z' key:
    Kirby inhales when standing still
    Kirby holds his breath when moving left or right
    Kirby slides when crouching and z is pressed
    Kirby attacks (exhales) when floating

Number keys (1, 2, 3, 4) can be used to show Kirby use a different power-up modes
(Normal, Beam, Fire, Spark). ***

Use 'e' to cause Kirby to take damage and get "thrown" until other movement is executed or he hits the edge of the screen.

Use keys "t" and "y" to cycle between which block is currently being shown.

Use keys "u" to hide item and "i" to show item.

Use keys "o" and "p" to cycle between which enemy or npc is currently being shown.

Use 'q' to quit and 'r' to reset the program back to its initial state.

*** NOTE: Due to time constraints and the overwhelming amount
of animations for each powerup, animations for Beam, Fire, and Spark Kirby (other
than right/left facing Kirby) have been backlogged. To be done by Sprint3.
